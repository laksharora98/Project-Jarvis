# Personal Relationships (The Dossier)

This directory serves as a "CRM" for personal and professional relationships. It aims to help track contacts, schedule interactions, and ensure meaningful connections are maintained.

## Core Objective
To combat isolation and proactively maintain a healthy social network by tracking details, last contact dates, and future plans for friends, family, and colleagues.

## Current Challenges
*   **Isolation**: Rarely reaching out to friends or extended family.
*   **Envy/Shame**: Avoiding social media (Insta/LinkedIn) because of feeling "behind" in life.
*   **Dating**: Fear of intimacy due to current mental/physical state ("Burning House" theory).

## Current Focus
*   **Immediate**: Coordinate travel for the wedding in Ashoknagar (Jan 29-30).
*   **Urgent**: **Build the "Dossier"**. This is critical to stop losing friends. Jot down details and schedule reach-outs.
*   **Action**: Respond to the intimate email from the colleague.

## Key Groups
*   **School Friends**: Reconnect.
*   **Undergrad (IITR) Friends**: Reconnect (lost touch post-MSc).
*   **Work Colleagues (Current & Past)**: Maintain and deepen connections.
*   **Family**: Regular check-ins.
