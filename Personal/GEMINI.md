# Personal Life

This directory is for managing various aspects of personal life. It is divided into sub-folders, each with its own `GEMINI.md` file.

Gemini should help capture and organize high-level personal information, goals, and principles in these `GEMINI.md` files, and reference more detailed documents as needed.
