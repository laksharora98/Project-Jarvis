# Personal Life

This directory is for managing various aspects of personal life. It is divided into sub-folders like `Health`, `Finance`, `Career`, and `Relationships`, each with its own `GEMINI.md` file.

## Sub-Directories
*   **Health**: Physical health, medical records, and home environment.
*   **Finance**: Budgeting, investments, tax planning, and banking.
*   **Career**: Upskilling, professional growth, and startup ambitions.
*   **Relationships**: The "Dossier" for tracking and maintaining social connections.

## Projects & Focus Areas

*   **Learning Sandbox**: A hands-on project (under Career?) for exploring a wide range of technologies, with a focus on building a state-of-the-art Customer Data Platform (CDP).
*   **Health**: Goals and tracking for personal health.
*   **Finance**: Goals and principles for personal finance.

Gemini should help capture and organize high-level personal information, goals, and principles in these `GEMINI.md` files, and reference more detailed documents as needed.
