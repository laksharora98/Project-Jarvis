# Career & Wealth

This directory is dedicated to professional growth, upskilling, and wealth creation. It addresses the need to move from "coasting" to high-performance and financial independence.

## Core Objective

## Strategic Goals
1.  **Upskilling**: Create and execute a learning plan (Data Science, Product Management, Engineering).
2.  **Wealth**: Explore paths to rapid wealth accumulation (Salary jumps vs. Startup).
3.  **Discipline**: Overcome procrastination and "coasting" habits.

## Current Focus
*   **Immediate**: Deliver on critical Aakash projects (PSERP, CDP, Data Lake 2.0) to regain confidence and professional standing.
*   **Planning**: Develop a detailed roadmap for skills to acquire over the next 6-12 months.
