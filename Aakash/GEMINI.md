# Professional Work: Aakash

This directory is for my professional work as **Laksh Arora**, a **Data Product Manager** at **Aakash Educational Services Limited** in Gurugram, India.

It is organized by company and then by project. Each project folder will have its own `GEMINI.md` file containing project-specific context, such as:

-   **Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)**
-   **Technical Architecture Overviews**
-   **Coding Guidelines and Best Practices**
-   **Key Decisions and Rationales**
-   **Project Roadmap and Milestones**

Gemini should proactively update these documents based on our discussions.
