# Stock Report Project

This document outlines the project details for the Stock Report at Aakash Educational Services Limited.

## Current Focus

We are currently in the process of documenting the existing Stock Report's technical details. The next step is for Laksh to provide the datasets and SQL queries, which will be recorded in the `Stock_Report_Technical_Details.md` file for analysis and future refactoring.
