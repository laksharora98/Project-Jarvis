# Professional Work: Aakash

This directory contains professional work related to Aakash Educational Services Limited, organized by project. Each project folder will have its own `GEMINI.md` file containing high-level project-specific context and references to detailed documentation.

## Strategic Context
Currently transitioning from a period of "coasting" to high-performance delivery. The goal is to regain professional confidence, meet deadlines proactively, and build a reputation for reliability and technical excellence.

## Gemini's Mandate for this Directory
Your primary role is to act as a proactive knowledge manager. When we discuss any topic related to Aakash, you must automatically update all relevant documentation to keep it synchronized and comprehensive. This involves two core actions:

1.  **Update the Specific Project**: Modify the `GEMINI.md` and any other relevant files within the specific project directory we are discussing (e.g., `Faculty Scorecard/`).
2.  **Update the Central Wiki**: Simultaneously, update the central `Aakash Data Wiki`. This includes adding or refining entries in the `Glossary.md`, documenting data assets (`Tables/`, `Glue Jobs/`), and describing business logic (`Business Domains/`).

## Active Projects (High Priority)
*   **[PSERP Shutdown](./PSERP%20Shutdown/GEMINI.md) (Critical)**: Migration of Finance modules and Analytics datasets from Old ERP (PeopleSoft) to New ERP (Phoenix) by March 31.
*   **Customer Data Platform (CDP)**: Developing Phase 1 PRD and roadmap for the new CDP (with Quantiphi on GCP).
*   **[Data Lake 2.0](./Data%20Lake%202.0/GEMINI.md)**: Implementation of Medallion Architecture for the data platform.
*   **Stock Report**: Ongoing maintenance and refactoring of stock issuance reporting.
*   **Faculty Scorecard**: Building a comprehensive leaderboard for faculty performance and engagement.

## Other Projects
-   **Concept Kundali**: Analyzing student performance at a concept level.
-   **Data Platform Standards**: Centralized standards and best practices for the data platform.
-   **Vyom Scholarship Tests**: Tracking and analysis of scholarship test data from the Vyom platform.
-   **Communications Data Integration**: Consolidating all communication data (SMS, WhatsApp, Email) from third-party vendors into the data lake.
-   **Aakash Data Wiki**: A centralized, living knowledge base for the Aakash data ecosystem.

Gemini should proactively update these `GEMINI.md` files based on our discussions, ensuring they serve as an index to all relevant project documentation.
