# Professional Work: Aakash

This directory contains professional work related to Aakash Educational Services Limited, organized by project. Each project folder will have its own `GEMINI.md` file containing high-level project-specific context and references to detailed documentation.

## Gemini's Mandate for this Directory

Your primary role is to act as a proactive knowledge manager. When we discuss any topic related to Aakash, you must automatically update all relevant documentation to keep it synchronized and comprehensive. This involves two core actions:

1.  **Update the Specific Project**: Modify the `GEMINI.md` and any other relevant files within the specific project directory we are discussing (e.g., `Faculty Scorecard/`).
2.  **Update the Central Wiki**: Simultaneously, update the central `Aakash Data Wiki`. This includes adding or refining entries in the `Glossary.md`, documenting data assets (`Tables/`, `Glue Jobs/`), and describing business logic (`Business Domains/`).

This dual-update process is crucial to ensure the **Aakash Data Wiki** evolves into the single source of truth.

## Projects

-   **Faculty Scorecard**: A project to build a comprehensive leaderboard for faculty performance and engagement.
-   **Stock Report**: A project to fix bugs and refactor the stock issuance report.
-   **Concept Kundali**: A project to analyze student performance at a concept level.
-   **Data Platform Standards**: Centralized standards and best practices for the data platform.
-   **Vyom Scholarship Tests**: Tracking and analysis of scholarship test data from the Vyom platform.
-   **Communications Data Integration**: A project to consolidate all communication data (SMS, WhatsApp, Email) from third-party vendors into the data lake.
-   **Aakash Data Wiki**: A centralized, living knowledge base for the Aakash data ecosystem.
-   **Customer Data Platform**: A project to develop a Customer Data Platform with Quantiphi on GCP.

Gemini should proactively update these `GEMINI.md` files based on our discussions, ensuring they serve as an index to all relevant project documentation.
