# Professional Work: Aakash

This directory contains professional work related to Aakash Educational Services Limited, organized by project. Each project folder will have its own `GEMINI.md` file containing high-level project-specific context and references to detailed documentation.

## Strategic Context
Currently transitioning from a period of "coasting" to high-performance delivery. The goal is to regain professional confidence, meet deadlines proactively, and build a reputation for reliability and technical excellence.

## Gemini's Mandate for this Directory
Your primary role is to act as a proactive knowledge manager. When we discuss any topic related to Aakash, you must automatically update all relevant documentation to keep it synchronized and comprehensive. This involves two core actions:

1.  **Update the Specific Project**: Modify the `GEMINI.md` and any other relevant files within the specific project directory we are discussing (e.g., `Faculty Scorecard/`).
2.  **Update the Central Wiki**: Simultaneously, update the central `Aakash Data Wiki`. This includes adding or refining entries in the `Glossary.md`, documenting data assets (`Tables/`, `Glue Jobs/`), and describing business logic (`Business Domains/`).

## Active Projects (High Priority)
*   **[Aakash Battleground](./Aakash%20Battleground/GEMINI.md) (Hackathon)**: A competitive, topic-wise quiz battleground prototype with real-time 1v1 battles.
*   **[PSERP Shutdown](./PSERP%20Shutdown/GEMINI.md) (Critical)**: Migration of Finance modules and Analytics datasets from Old ERP (PeopleSoft) to New ERP (Phoenix) by March 31.
*   **[Customer Data Platform (CDP)](./Customer%20Data%20Platform/GEMINI.md) (CRITICAL)**: Phase 1 PRD delayed. Manager relationship strained. **Monday Showdown Imminent.**
*   **[Data Lake 2.0](./Data%20Lake%202.0/GEMINI.md)**: Implementation of Medallion Architecture.

## Current Operational Crisis
*   **The "Shadow Engineer" Trap**: You are personally coding fixes/deployments instead of raising tickets. This creates a dependency on you and prevents you from doing high-value PM work (PRDs, Strategy).
*   **Data Lake "Wild West"**: No environments (Dev/Stage/Prod), direct table editing, hardcoded logic, repeated code, and no governance. The "Data Lake 2.0" project is the fix for this, but current BAU is drowning you.
*   **Immediate Threat**: Meeting with Manager on Monday regarding missed CDP deadlines and overall performance.

## Other Projects
-   **Concept Kundali**: Analyzing student performance at a concept level.
-   **Data Platform Standards**: Centralized standards and best practices for the data platform.
-   **Vyom Scholarship Tests**: Tracking and analysis of scholarship test data from the Vyom platform.
-   **Communications Data Integration**: Consolidating all communication data (SMS, WhatsApp, Email) from third-party vendors into the data lake.
-   **Aakash Data Wiki**: A centralized, living knowledge base for the Aakash data ecosystem.

Gemini should proactively update these `GEMINI.md` files based on our discussions, ensuring they serve as an index to all relevant project documentation.
