# Data Platform Standards

This directory contains the official standards and best practices for the Aakash data platform. The goal of these standards is to ensure that our data ecosystem is reliable, scalable, and easy to use.

All new data projects and pipelines **must** adhere to the guidelines documented in `data_platform_standards.md`.
