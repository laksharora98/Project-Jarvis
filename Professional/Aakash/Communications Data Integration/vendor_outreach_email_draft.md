Subject: Data Export API for Aakash Educational Services Limited

Hi [Vendor Team],

I am writing from Aakash Educational Services Limited. We are currently working on a project to consolidate all our communication data into a central data lake for comprehensive internal reporting and analytics. Our data lake is hosted on AWS S3.

To achieve this, we need to set up an automated pipeline to pull daily data for all communications (such as SMS, WhatsApp, and email) sent from any account or sub-account associated with Aakash Educational Services Limited through your platform.

Could you please provide us with the following information:

1.  **Data Export Method**: What is the best method to receive a daily, automated export of our communication data? We are open to either a pull mechanism (via a reporting API) or a push mechanism from your end. If you have a direct connector for AWS S3, that would be ideal.
2.  **API Documentation**: If a pull-based API is the recommended approach, could you please provide the relevant documentation?
3.  **Available Data Fields**: A complete list of the data fields available in the export (e.g., timestamp, sender, recipient, message content, delivery status, cost, etc.).
4.  **Associated Costs**: Please let us know if there are any costs associated with setting up or using this data export, for either a push or pull method.

Our goal is to ensure we can programmatically retrieve a complete record of all our communications activities.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,

Laksh Arora
