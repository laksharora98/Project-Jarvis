# Communications Data Integration

## Project Overview

This project aims to consolidate all outbound communication data from various third-party vendors into the central Aakash Data Lake. Currently, data from the internal "Commbox" system is available, but communications sent via marketing platforms (like WebEngage) or directly from vendor portals are not captured. This project will establish daily automated data pipelines to ingest this missing data to enable comprehensive, advanced analytics and reporting.
