# Faculty Scorecard Project

This document outlines the Product Requirements Document (PRD) for the Faculty Scorecard project at Aakash Educational Services Limited.

## Project Overview

The Faculty Scorecard project aims to build a comprehensive leaderboard for all faculty at Aakash. This leaderboard will be based on data gathered from various sources, with parameters and their weightages to be defined. The project will also involve defining the calculation logic for each parameter's score and building a reporting mechanism for users to access the leaderboard and raw data.
