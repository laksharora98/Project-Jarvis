**Faculty Scorecard Breakdown**

This scorecard evaluates faculty performance across eight key factors from 10th July 2024 to 9th July 2025. The final score is a weighted average of percentile ranks, not a sum of points.

*   **Test Performance (Weight: 10%):** Assesses student performance in tests attributed to the faculty compared to the national average.
*   **Test Attendance (Weight: 5%):** Measures the percentage of tests attempted by students assigned to the faculty.
*   **Student Attendance (Weight: 5%):** Tracks the percentage of classes students attended for the faculty.
*   **Syllabus Compliance (Weight: 10%):** The faculty's diligence in marking syllabus completion for their lectures.
*   **Class Attendance Compliance (Weight: 5%):** The faculty's diligence in marking student attendance for their classes.
*   **Student Feedback (Weight: 15%):** The average CSAT rating received from students for the subjects taught by the faculty.
*   **Student Retention (Weight: 10%):** Assesses the percentage of students retained under the faculty's instruction.
*   **Student Conversion (Weight: 10%):** Measures the percentage of a faculty's students who enroll in a subsequent course.

**NOTE:**
A faculty member will not receive a final score or rank if they do not have a valid score for every KPI. This can happen if they do not meet a KPI's minimum data threshold (e.g., minimum tests, students, or feedback) or if they could not be mapped to any student. For Test Attendance, Retention, and Conversion, scores are ranked within the faculty's stream (e.g., Medical vs. Medical) for a fairer comparison.
